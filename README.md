##Disclaimer
Because this needs to connect through wifi to your GoPro, it's best if you run all of it locally.

#How it works
- Connect to your GoPros wireless network.
- Download, clone or fork this repo.
- Run `npm install` in the root directory
- Run `npm run` in the root directory
- Go to `localhost:8080`
- Press record
- Do something goofy for 5 seconds
- Once the camera has completed the clip, you will be able to either replay the video in slow motion or to take a new clip
